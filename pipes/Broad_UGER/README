This folder contains scripts related to running the viral-ngs pipeline 
on the Broad's Univa GridEngine system. It is no longer supported as
a production analysis environment for viral-ngs, but the original scripts
are retained here for reference for anyone wishing to adapt the Snakemake
pipelines to a GridEngine-like environment.
