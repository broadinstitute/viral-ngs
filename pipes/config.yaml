# The lastal tool filters input reads to be more representative of the genus of
# interest. By default, the accesstions given for the reference genome are used
# (accessions_for_ref_genome_build). Optionally, a path to a text file can be
# given, the text file itself listing accessions to be used in place of the
# reference accessions for building the lastal database. If the species of
# interest has significant genetic diversity, the lastal filtering step can be
# made more inclusive by expanding the list of accessions given in this file to
# a set that better represents possible diversity. If assemblies are failing due
# to insufficient input data, consider expanding the list of accessions given to lastal.
