This folder contains scripts related to running the viral-ngs pipeline 
on the Broad's old LSF scheduler system. It is no longer supported as a 
production analysis environment (as it no longer exists at the Broad), 
but the original scripts are retained here for reference for anyone 
wishing to adapt the Snakemake pipelines to an LSF scheduler.
