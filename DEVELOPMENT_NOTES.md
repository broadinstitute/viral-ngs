### Installation, dependencies, and manual deployment requirements

#### Dependency install destinations
When Python and binary dependencies for viral-ngs are installed by conda, they can end up in several locations. The default and preferred method of installation assumes a conda environment is active in the current shell, complete with [environment variables we can access to specify the path of the active environment](https://github.com/broadinstitute/viral-ngs/blob/master/tools/__init__.py#L240). In this case, conda packages are installed in the active conda environment. If conda is installed and available on the path but no environment is currently active, viral-ngs dependencies are installed in isolation within `viral-ngs/tools/build/conda-tools/{default}` (unless this location is overridden in the CondaPackage() constructor). For tools without a conda recipe (as may be the case on certain platforms, like Mac OSX), or where conda install fails, custom install methods are used to download and build some tools.

#### Adding a new tool or dependency
When adding a new tool or dependency to viral-ngs, check to see if a conda package is already available either on the default channel (`conda search <package_name>`), or on the bioconda channel (`conda search -c bioconda <package_name>`). If so, it will needed to be added to the conda recipe template for viral-ngs. If a recipe is unavailable, it will first need to be added to a particular conda channel. [Bioconda](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes) is used by default.

#### Changing dependency versions
The viral-ngs package installed by `conda install viral-ngs` from the [broad-viral channel](https://anaconda.org/broad-viral/viral-ngs) depends on a conda build recipe distributed in this repository. The recipe files source the various Python and binary depedencies of viral-ngs as conda packages, including version numbers, from the `requirements-*.txt` files within this repository.

### (Automated) testing 
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/broadinstitute/viral-ngs) performs automated unit and integration tests for viral-ngs on each branch and pull request. Unit tests are run on each new branch commit, and longer integration tests are performed on pull requests to help ensure the stability of the `master` branch. Pull requests are gated to ensure merging to `master` is allowed only if all tests pass. The Travis configuration is specified in `.travis.yml`, and relies on files stored within `viral-ngs/travis/`.

A few notes on testing: 
- Travis Linux with Py3 is the authoritative test server
- Tox is present for convenience (local use only, not currently in use on Travis)
- `py.test` is used in place of `nose` or the built-in `unittest` framework for its generative testing, fixtures, and parallelized execution of tests. 
- `.flake8`, `.pylintrc`, and `.style.yapf` are available in the repository root, and should be used when running the associated tools
- During Travis tests an encrypted tarball of third-party resources is downloaded into the build environment to provide a licensed copy of GATK and Novoalign. For security, forks of viral-ngs [will not have](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests#Security-Restrictions-when-testing-Pull-Requests) the encrypted resources available for testing on Travis, nor will pull requests from forks.
- Many tests for viral-ngs depend on static input files distributed with the repository. The test input files reside in `viral-ngs/test/input/<TestClassName>`. Within specific unit tests, class-specific test input files may be accessed via the function `util.file.get_test_input_path(self)`. The parent directory for all static test files can be accessed via `util.file.get_test_path()`

#### The Travis build matrix
Each commit on any branch, and any pull request, will trigger a build on Travis CI. Branch commits will test code from a specific commit hash. Pull requests will test the simulated result of merging a branch HEAD onto the target branch HEAD. For each build, the following Travis jobs are launched:
1. `py.test` is run on Python 2.7. Tool dependencies are installed prior to unit tests via conda. Unit tests are run with every branch commit. Integration tests are only run on master branch commits or pull requests. The Travis cache is cleared for each tagged release. This typically completes in 10-15 minutes, about half of which are the installation of dependencies.
2. `py.test` is run on Python 3.6. Tool dependencies are installed prior to unit tests via conda. Unit tests are run with every branch commit. Integration tests are only run on master branch commits or pull requests. The Travis cache is cleared for each tagged release. This typically completes in 10-15 minutes, about half of which are the installation of dependencies.
3. Documentation is built automatically. It is not deployed to Read the Docs--this test only exists on Travis in order to bring the developer's attention to any auto build problems. Read the Docs has its own auto build process separate from Travis (see section below) but it does not notify anyone of its build failures. This usually completes in less than 1 minute.
4. The `viral-ngs` conda package is built and deployed to the `broad-viral` channel. This requires anaconda.org credentials stored as an encrypted Travis variable. This is the longest build job and can take 20-30 minutes.

5. Docker
   1. A docker image is built and deployed to DockerHub. Master branch images are pushed to `broadinstitute/viral-ngs:latest` and are also given a versioned tag. Non-master branch images and pull requests are pushed to `broadinstitute/viral-ngs-dev` with versioned tags. The docker build is preceded by a docker pull of `broadinstitute/viral-ngs:latest` in order to utilize layer caching. Note that our tool dependencies result in a very large docker image (2GB compressed). The Dockerfile builds the tool dependencies before incorporating the full viral-ngs source code. This means that most docker image builds will be extremely fast: usually 10-20 seconds. The docker push/deploy is similarly fast, since DockerHub already has most of the layers. The docker pull of the 2GB image takes about 5 minutes, so altogether this step takes about 6 minutes on Travis. However, if your code commit alters anything in `requirements-*.txt` or the easy deploy script, it will rebuild the heavy conda install layer, adding another 10 minutes or so to this build. The docker push requires DockerHub credentials, stored as an encrypted Travis variable.
   2. After the docker image is deployed, WDL pipeline files are edited to reflect the version tag of the recently pushed docker image. A WDL validator is then run (using wdltool.jar) to ensure that all WDL files are still valid.
   3. WDL pipelines are compiled to DNAnexus workflows using dxWDL.jar. These are deployed to a DNAnexus CI project using an API token stored as an encrypted Travis variable. (TO DO: DNAnexus workflows should eventually be tested)
   4. (TO DO: WDL pipelines are tested on Cromwell)
   5. (TO DO: maybe move all Snakemake tests here and some `py.test` unit tests some day?)

### Building documentation
Documentation is built automatically for certain branches of viral-ngs by [Read the Docs](http://viral-ngs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The documentation template files reside within `viral-ngs/docs`, and are formatted in standard docutils [reStructuredText format](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html). [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) may be used for converting from other formats (such as Markdown) to reStructuredText. The `sphinx-argparse` module is used to automatically generate documentation for the argparse parsers used in viral-ngs.
